This is not the final version. Please report any bugs you encounter and post suggestions you have.
Automatic updates are only available if you have Beardlib.

Ideas I currently have:
1. ~~Add a popup window with information on build you're about to load~~
2. ~~Export your in-game build to PD2Builder link~~
3. Updating the menu screen when you load your build
4. ~~Add a warning when deck/grenade in build you are trying to load is in DLC you don't own~~
5. Add a warning when you don't have enough skill points to load a build
6. Localization support
